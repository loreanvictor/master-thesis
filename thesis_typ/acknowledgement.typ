    I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Stephan Krusche for enabling and supporting this work. I would also like to thank the whole Artemis team for direct and indirect help and support throughout this thesis, and for having created such a vibrant environment where a constant influx of passionate students can contribute to real-world projects used by thousands of other students and instructors through their work and research. I would like to specifically mention members of the Apollon team Matthias Lehner and Alexander GÃ¶rtzen for their continuous support and feedback.

    I would also express my sincere gratitude to my family and friends for their ever-present support and encouragement throughout my studies, specifically my fiancee Dr. Niyousha Karimi Paridari for accompanying me on this journey and making it a lot more enjoyable and memorable.
