abstract = {Abstract The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was created on the basis of expert opinion and has now become accepted as the ‘standard’ object-oriented modelling notation. Our objectives were to determine how widely the notations of the UML, and their usefulness, have been studied empirically, and to identify which aspects of it have been studied in most detail. We undertook a mapping study of the literature to identify relevant empirical studies and to classify them in terms of the aspects of the UML that they studied. We then conducted a systematic literature review, covering empirical studies published up to the end of 2008, based on the main categories identified. We identified 49 relevant publications, and report the aggregated results for those categories for which we had enough papers— metrics, comprehension, model quality, methods and tools and adoption. Despite indications that a number of problems exist with UML models, researchers tend to use the UML as a ‘given’ and seem reluctant to ask questions that might help to make it more effective.

abstract = {Modeling is an important skill in software engineering. However, it is often not tangible for students and not appreciated. Students prefer coding because they receive immediate feedback from the compiler. Engaging students in modeling is difficult, especially in large introductory courses.We have developed an interactive learning method for modeling which is based on an easy to use online editor. Students learn modeling in guided tutorials in the lecture right after the theory is introduced and deepen their modeling skills in group work and homework exercises. This learning method was applied in a large introductory course with more than 1000 students.An empirical evaluation of the method demonstrated that the students' learning outcome in modeling improved significantly by up to 87 \%. Students are motivated to use models in their future projects and understand how to approach problems with models. The use of interactive models in programming exercises improves their understanding of the taught concepts.},
